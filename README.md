# Weather App ðŸŒ¦

## Introduction âœ¨
This weather app was developed to provide users with accurate weather information in a user-friendly way. It uses a weather API to provide current weather details, and by leveraging the features of geolocator and geocoding, the application effectively pinpoints your actual location. It also provides 5-day/3-hour forecasting as well as the ability to search for weather in any city in the whole world. The application was developed using the MVC architecture and is handled using GetX state management.
